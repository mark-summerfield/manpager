# Manpager

A GUI Unix man page viewer (an alternative to gman).

Manpager presents a browsable tree view of the systemâ€™s man pages.

It also supports apropos (keyword), full text, and man page name searches.

Man page links (e.g., `man(7)`) that appear in pages are clickable links
which change the display to the clicked man page. Similarly web links are
clickable (using showing pages in your web browser).

When launched from the command line you can provide a word (apropos) to
search for in which case Manpager will begin with that search. Otherwise at
startup it will show either a random man page or the last viewed page
depending on your Config preference.

Note: I use [Store](https://github.com/mark-summerfield/store) for version
control so github is only used to make the code public.
